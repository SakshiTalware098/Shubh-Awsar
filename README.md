Needed Softwares for working of website :
1) XAMPP control panel v3.3.0
2) Visual Studio Code


Firstly we need to make sure that all the files downloaded by you should be stored in a particular folder named as :
  - EventManagement1

Now the EventManagement1 folder created should be present in htdocs folder, and for this htdocs folder go into your file explorer and within file explorer fo the following path :
  - "C:\xampp\htdocs"

Once all your files are set into htdocs folder go ahead with the steps as...

Open XAMPP control panel and..
~ Go for the Admin option of MySql module
~ Now you will get redirected to Chrome and get the interface of phpMyadmin
~ Within this interface, Create a new database named as event_management
~ Within event_management database create new table and 
  : for new table import the sql file named as contact.sql
  : also do create another table for same event_management database and do import the other sql file named as users.sql
  
And here your SETUP is done!!!!!!

Now simply open new tab in chrome and type the following command :
  -- http://localhost/EventManagement1/login.php

And there we go.. here's your WEBSITE ready for uhh.
